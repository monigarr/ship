## **Category 8: Security Audit**

What you are measuring: The real attack surface of a production government web application. Ship has authentication, WebSocket connections, user-generated content, a PostgreSQL backend, and third-party dependencies. Your job is not to run a scanner and report the output. Your job is to build a tool that actively probes the running application, then interpret what it finds.

### **The Security Probe Tool**

You must build a security probe tool as part of this category. The tool is a deliverable, not optional. It must be a runnable script or CLI that actively tests the live application across at least four attack surfaces:

* Authentication and session handling: test for weak session tokens, missing token expiry, unauthenticated route access, and privilege escalation between user roles  
* WebSocket message validation: send malformed, oversized, and unexpected message types to the WebSocket endpoint. Does the server crash, silently accept invalid state, or reject correctly?  
* Input sanitization: test for XSS, SQL injection, and excessively long input across all user-facing fields. Include both stored and reflected vectors  
* Dependency vulnerabilities: programmatically run npm audit and parse the output. Flag any high or critical CVEs and identify which application features depend on the vulnerable package

The tool must produce a structured report (JSON or markdown) with findings, severity ratings, and reproduction steps for each issue. It must be runnable by a grader against a fresh instance of the app with a single command.

### **Manual Review Requirements**

In addition to the probe tool, conduct manual review of:

* CORS and CSP configuration: are cross-origin requests properly restricted?  
* Environment variable and secret handling: are secrets ever exposed to the client bundle or logged?  
* Rate limiting: can a single client hammer the API or WebSocket endpoint without restriction?  
* Error message verbosity: do error responses leak stack traces, SQL, or internal paths?

### **Audit Deliverable**

| Metric | Your Baseline |
| :---- | :---- |
| Security probe tool | Runnable (Yes / No) |
| Auth/session vulnerabilities found | List with severity |
| WebSocket validation failures | List with severity |
| Input sanitization failures | List with severity |
| High/Critical CVEs in dependencies | Count \+ list |
| CORS/CSP misconfiguration | Yes / No \+ details |
| Secrets exposure risk | Yes / No \+ details |
| Rate limiting absent on endpoints | List |
| Verbose error leakage | Yes / No \+ examples |

### **Improvement Target**

Fix at least 2 verified vulnerabilities with before/after proof. Each fix must include: the vulnerability class, the reproduction steps used to confirm it, the fix applied, and evidence that the fix works (tool output before vs. after, or a test that catches the regression). Fixes must not break existing tests.
