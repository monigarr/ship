Understand it deeply. Measure its health.
Diagnose its weaknesses. Make it better
with proof.

You will spend more time understanding existing patterns than
creating new ones. This week the audit is the deliverable. Reading
code is not preparation for the work — reading code is the work.

   A written report with baseline measurements for       Measurable improvement in every category — not
   all seven categories. Tools, methodology, raw data,   pick-three. Before/after benchmarks, identical
   ranked findings. You do not fix anything during the   conditions, tests still passing, root cause
   audit.                                                documented.
